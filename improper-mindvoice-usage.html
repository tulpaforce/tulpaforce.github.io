<h2 class="wsite-content-title" style="text-align:left;">Improper Mindvoice Usage <font size="3">by <span style="">zerofox21898</span></font></h2>

<div><div id="267353328683106644" align="left" style="width: 100%; overflow-y: hidden;" class="wcustomhtml"><div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With both of my <a href="faq--glossary.html#vocal" class="glossarylink">vocal</a> tulpa, I had noticed that they never really  seemed all that "alien" or good at <a href="faq--glossary.html#parallelprocessing" class="glossarylink">parallel processing</a>.  These are my  thoughts as to why so many <a href="faq--glossary.html#host" class="glossarylink">hosts</a> have been having trouble with thought  independence lately and how to fix the problem. The basic idea is that our tulpa are sending unprocessed thoughts to us  rather than thoughts in word form like we send to them.  This is an  idea I'm sure most people in the community have considered.  I guess  this is just my way of sorting it out and adding to it.<br /> <br /> 	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The process would be that the tulpa attempts to communicate with the  host, but instead of using words, they send raw thoughts, not even  knowing that they are doing it incorrectly.  Vanille tells me that this  has been a problem for her now that she looks back on it.  She seems to believe this theory.  Once the thoughts reach the host, their brain  automatically puts them into word form.  Because they are translating  the thoughts themselves, the "alien feeling" that used to be associated  with a tulpa's first words is lost.  At this point, one of two things  can happen.  The host can take what is said as the tulpa, or they can  dismiss it as <a href="faq--glossary.html#parroting" class="glossarylink">parroting</a>.  In the former situation, the tulpa is glad  that they are heard, but usually it will take a while for the tulpa to  learn to use the mindvoice properly.  In the latter, the tulpa may  become discouraged, but with time, they will learn to use it correctly.<br /> <br /> 	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since we have taken the first road and she has yet to master speaking, I  told Vanille to mouth out her words, something she says she hasn't  really done before.  I like everyone else, have always sort of moved my  throat in accordance with my thoughts.  I think this functions as a kind  of grounding, and almost a form of symbolism in getting my words sorted  out, just as it should with a tulpa, or at least that's the idea.  I'm  sure we can all use raw thought ourselves, but the problem with that,  while it is much faster, is that it isn't "solid" for lack of a better  word.  The thoughts are always hard to remember and hard to process.   After learning to speak, the brain makes it habit to sort of  auto-translate thoughts into words.  I guess this should be obvious, but  I feel it's necessary to record.  This is likely why the brain seems to  auto-translate a tulpa's raw thoughts.<br /> <br /> 	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another idea was that this could be the reason many hosts are having  parallel processing issues lately.  For example, if your tulpa is  sending you the answer to a math problem, and it's sent via raw thought,  it's only natural that you would assume it's coming from yourself if  there is no alien feeling backing it up, especially if you're already so  used to translating these raw thoughts yourself.  Maybe, when we think a  tulpa is leeching off of our thoughts, or even worse, we're <a href="faq--glossary.html#parroting" class="glossarylink">puppeting</a>  them, in reality it's merely us picking up their own thoughts.  I  actually have experience backing this up myself.  The two of us have  taken a brilliant parallel processing test in which you would watch two  sets of balls pass by.  One of us would count one side while the other  would count the opposite.  While we messed up the first two times, it  wasn't far off and the third was actually perfect.  Despite this, I've  always felt weird asking her math questions, like she was just reading  my own thoughts for the answer.  I think that what really was going on  was that she was trying to send me the answers she calculated herself,  but they felt like my own due to this type of communication.<br /> <br /> 	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One other thing I suppose I should discuss is what would happen if the  tulpa sent thoughts as well as words to you at once like I feel Vanille  sometimes does when she isn't really focusing on communicating with me.   This sort of communication isn't nearly as awkward, but it still isn't  quite right.  The most obvious effect would be that we get a feeling of  what the tulpa is going to say just before they say it.  I'm sure  everyone with a tulpa has had this before.  I do not believe that this  means the tulpa is not sentient.  I think it simply indicates that they  cannot properly use the mindvoice yet.  Honestly, I feel like there is  more to write concerning these instances, but I can't quite remember  what it was.<br /> <br /> 	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, knowing all of this, what are some things we can do to alleviate  the issue?  I think the biggest thing is to simply recognize the problem  and to notify the tulpa.  Like I suggested before, have them speak the  words they are saying, not "send the thoughts at you" I guess you could  say.  It may seem unnecessary to the tulpa and even though it is only  symbolism, something I generally despise, this seems like the best way.   The last thing is to set up a sort of barrier between your thoughts and  your tulpa's, something many people have suggested before.  I think the  biggest difference between those guides and this one is that you are  actively recognizing the problem and putting a possible explanation  behind it, tying it all together and understanding it.  In the tulpa  community, those who are painfully logical, myself included, seem  increasingly at a disadvantage with this whole "just have faith" ideology.  I think the biggest problem for us is that there is no  explanation behind the idea.  This method doesn't exactly make faith  unnecessary, but it certainly makes it easier to have."<br /><span><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://community.tulpa.info/thread-improper-usage-of-the-mindvoice-s-effects-on-thought-independence-and-the-solution"><span>Original guide</span></a></span> </div></div></div>
