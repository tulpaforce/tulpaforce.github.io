<h2 class="wsite-content-title" style="text-align:left;">Communication <font size="3">by Kiahdaj (Kiahdaj's Absolute Guide to Tulpas</font>)<br /></h2>

<div><div id="916434395207895859" align="left" style="width: 100%; overflow-y: hidden;" class="wcustomhtml"><div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many guides in the past have suggested that if you can&rsquo;t hear your tulpa, that means he doesn&rsquo;t know how to talk. That is not true. The problem is, you cannot hear him. My tulpa has said that he could speak just fine, since shortly after his first memory. It just took me a long time to hear him. So this &ldquo;step&rdquo;, like almost every other, is pretty much entirely up to you. However, since it is more complicated to say &ldquo;your ability to hear them&rdquo; every time, I will henceforth refer to it as speech, but I am truly referring to your ability to hear them.<br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, I don&rsquo;t consider this so much of a step, like personality and visualization have been. Generally, speech tends to come on its own, in time. However, if you want to try to expedite the process, there are things that you can try.&nbsp;<br /><span style=""></span><br /><font size="4"><strong>The Process:</strong></font><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First off, let&rsquo;s discuss the state of mind you are to have, when trying to hear your tulpa. Many people will tell you to &ldquo;clear your mind&rdquo;. Clearing your mind usually involves blocking out thought, so to speak. That very thing is what I&rsquo;ve found that you should not do. I am technically speaking for myself here, because people do work differently, but it certainly makes sense to me. Your tulpa's first way of communicating with you is via &ldquo;thoughts&rdquo;. You might have been under the impression that when you first heard them, it would be in their voice, sounding clear as day. That is certainly not the truth, but I will get to that later.<br /><span></span><br /><span style=""></span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyway, since your tulpa&rsquo;s means of communication is through thought, blocking out all thought in attempt to clear your mind will result in you blocking out his thoughts as well. I find that to this day, if I try to clear my mind like that, I cannot hear him.&nbsp; Someone has recently suggested in a guide of his, that in stead of clearing your mind, you should think a lot--throw a lot of thoughts around, and so forth. I think that this is bogus, for a similar reason. If you think too much, or too hard, their thoughts to you will get mixed up with your own. Like the last example, to this day, if I am thinking extremely hard about something, I usually cannot hear him. <br /><span style=""></span><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The perfect state to be in, from my, and several others&rsquo; experience, is to just not think. Don&rsquo;t make a conscious effort to block any thoughts out, even your own. Just try not to think. That way, you allow your tulpa&rsquo;s thoughts to reach you, and with minimal clutter. Another way someone has put it is to &ldquo;listen out for them&rdquo;. I used to think that this means the same as &ldquo;clear your mind&rdquo;; after all, it&rsquo;d be easier to listen out for them, if you&rsquo;re not thinking. Listening out for them is a little difficult to describe. It&rsquo;s a lot easier to do, when you already have a feel for their &ldquo;essence&rdquo;.<br /><span style=""></span><br /><font size="4"><strong>How it Will Happen:</strong></font><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like I said before, when you first hear your tulpa, it will not be just their voice, clear as day, saying something to you. The first way you will ever &ldquo;hear&rdquo; your tulpa will be through thought. Not thought, as in hearing their <a href="faq--glossary.html#mindvoice" class="glossarylink">mindvoice</a>, but the intent behind their thoughts. Allow me to explain: There are two levels of thought. The second level is how surely all of you perceive thought. It&rsquo;s what you hear when you read this to yourself in your head. You think to yourself, and you can hear it in your mind&rsquo;s ear. Most people believe that we think through words, or language. That is not entirely true.<br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first level of thought is intent. It is the intent behind your words. When someone says something to you, you first get a feeling of what it is you want to express to them. You then convert that feeling into words, so that you can converse with them. Intent being the first level of thought is why you sometimes find yourself wanting to say something, but are unable to think of the words. You cannot find a way to translate that feeling accurately with your known vocabulary. <br /><span style=""></span><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So this -- the intent behind your tulpa&rsquo;s thoughts -- is likely the first way you will ever be able to accurately communicate with them. Their intent is sent over to you, and then you translate the intent into words. This is why many hosts say that at first, they can hardly differentiate between their tulpa&rsquo;s and their own thoughts. That is because, like when you think, you are the one translating that intent. Also, when you are first able to communicate via intent, you may find that you can&rsquo;t always hear their responses. It could be as simple as you just not quite catching the intent. Or, as I&rsquo;ve experienced it, you were unable to translate it. <br /><span style=""></span><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There were many times where I could feel him trying to talk to me, but didn&rsquo;t get any words out of it. The conclusion I came to is that he was trying to say something that was too complicated for me to &ldquo;translate&rdquo;. And sure enough, when I asked him a question that I knew would require a more complicated answer, the same thing happened.<br /><span style=""></span><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now you may be wondering, &ldquo;If it sounds just like your thought, how will you ever know it&rsquo;s your tulpa?&rdquo;. There are many different ways. For starters, when you ask them a question, and give them a window for them to say something back, and you get a response. Sure it&rsquo;s technically possible that it was you, but what did I say about belief? <br /><span style=""></span><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, is when they say things that surprise you. There are many times that my tulpa has said something that I wouldn&rsquo;t normally think. This ended up as me having a thought pop into my head that I didn&rsquo;t feel was mine. Bam. That&rsquo;s also a way that you can be sure that the response you get is from them. My heart has actually skipped a beat at what my tulpa&rsquo;s said, before. I just wasn&rsquo;t expecting it. And how could you possibly be that surprised by something you just thought?&nbsp;<br /><span style=""></span><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyway, over time, your tulpa&rsquo;s intent will start to feel more and more distinct, and feel more &ldquo;alien&rdquo;, as some have put it. It will have its own feel to it, and become stronger. The step after that is when you begin to faintly hear your tulpa&rsquo;s mindvoice. Once again, this likely won&rsquo;t happen all at one time. It will most likely start by you hearing bits and pieces of what they&rsquo;re saying, in their mindvoice. And then, as you talk to them, and listen to them more, their mindvoice will become more and more distinct. Eventually it will get to the point where you can hear them every time they talk to you, and hear them as distinctly as you hear your own thoughts. At this point, it is safe to say that you are done with the &ldquo;speech&rdquo; step. And now, you eagerly await auditory imposition.<br /><span><br /><span><a title="" target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/17iiFxZ9PYXXxSqWHdU2YoPsGfJr90w8aIG_evqc1wiY/edit#">Original Guide</a><br /></span></span></div></div></div>
